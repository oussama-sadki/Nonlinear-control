Nonlinear control of a two degree of freedom robot : Comparaison between First and Higher Order Sliding Mode Control
This project aims to enlighten the advantage of Super-Twisting algorithm in completely removing chattering produced by the discontinous part of the control signal which spell disaster consequences of the actuator at worse and increasing losses at best.
