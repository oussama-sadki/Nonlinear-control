# Nonlinear-control
Nonlinear control of a two degree of freedom robot : Comparaison between First and Higher Order Sliding Mode Control.


This project aims to enlighten the advantage of Super-Twisting algorithm in completely removing chattering produced by the discontinous part of the control signal which could lead to degrading actuator lifespan at worst and increasing losses at best.
